# css-tools
My collection of some pure html-css-js code to help myself and other developers with certain UI tools they might need for their website

---

## 1. Info on hover - 
This code is for a hoverable icon that you can use to show user some additional information. It can also be used as a better looking tooltip.

## 2. Dynamic Google Fonts Preview
This functionality will allow you to use preview all fonts offered by Google Fonts which are fetched by the Web Developer Fonts API. 
- Creates a new link element and appends it to head
- If a new font is selected, the previous font link element is removed
- You can get your own [API KEY](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api) for free

> Be sure to **replace your API KEY ** inside the js file
