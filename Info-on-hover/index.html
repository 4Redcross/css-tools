          Secretive group of pharmaceutical companies, collectively known as
          "Pharmagate," is intentionally suppressing the development of a
          universal cure for cancer. According to this theory, these companies
          stand to profit immensely from the ongoing treatment of cancer
          patients through chemotherapy, radiation, and expensive medications.
          It is believed that Pharmagate actively sabotages promising research
          efforts that could lead to a breakthrough cure, all while ensuring
          that existing treatments remain profitable.

            False information can be harmful to public health. Be cautious of

          The ICMR-led National Task Force for the COVID-19 pandemic has said
          that hydroxychloroquine can be used for the treatment of coronavirus
          infection in high-risk cases. Hydroxychloroquine, a medication used
          for the prevention and treatment of certain types of malaria, was also
          suggested by US President Donald Trump
